# FxOSApp

This is a demo app for Firefox OS, loosely based on [fxosstub](https://github.com/Jaxo/fxosstub)

It will give you a button to install it in Firefox OS, on a device or in the [Firefox OS Simulator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/) ([Simulator Introduction](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/12/firefox-os-simulator-1-0-is-here/)) and in certain [Nightly versions of Firefox](http://nightly.mozilla.org/).

It is then a showcase of WebActivities and other things in Firefox OS!
